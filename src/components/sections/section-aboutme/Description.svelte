<p>Hello, I'm Nash, a software developer based in Vancouver.</p>
<p>
  I love creating degital things like websites, applications, tools, design and
  etc.
</p>
<p>
  After graduating from <a href="https://www.meiji.ac.jp/cip/english/index.html"
    >Meiji University</a
  > in Japan, I joined some developer teams as a worker or freelancer.
</p>
<p>Here are the tech stacks I've been working recently.</p>

<style lang="scss">
  p {
    font-size: 1.1rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
  }
</style>
